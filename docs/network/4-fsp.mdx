The Flare Systems Protocol (FSP) is a foundational infrastructure designed to support Flare's enshrined protocols (technically referred to as sub-protocols).
Its primary goal is to facilitate secure, efficient, and decentralized consensus mechanisms through weighted voting by a select group of entities known as voters.
These voters are off-chain participants who accrue vote power from the Flare community via delegations of wrapped FLR tokens (WFLR) or stakes.

FSP ensures that agreements on off-chain data or calculations are reached securely and fairly, enabling the reliable operation of sub-protocols
like the [Flare Time Series Oracle](/ftso/overview) and the [Flare Data Connector](/fdc/overview).

**Key FSP Features:**

- **Decentralized Governance**: Through a weighted voting system involving a diverse set of voters.
- **Efficient Data Management**: By offloading complex calculations off-chain and minimizing on-chain storage requirements.
- **Robust Reward Mechanisms**: Incentivizing participation and penalizing delays or non-compliance to maintain network health.
- **Extensibility**: Designed to support additional sub-protocols and future enhancements like C-chain staking.
- **Security**: Implements mechanisms to prevent malicious behavior and ensures data integrity through Merkle proofs.

## Key Components

### Voters

**Role and Selection**

- **Participants**: Voters are off-chain entities that play a crucial role in the consensus mechanism by participating in threshold weighted voting across all sub-protocols.
- **Selection Criteria**: They are anticipated to be up to 100 entities, selected in a decentralized manner from validators with the highest vote power. The vote power is determined by the combination of stakes and WFLR delegations they receive from the community.

**Vote Power Sources**

- **P-chain Stake**: Voters can obtain vote power by staking FLR tokens on the P-chain. Stakes are bound for a specific period and cannot be removed prematurely.
- **C-chain Stake**: Not currently implemented, however this could allow for slashable stakes.
- **WFLR Delegation**: Community members can delegate their WFLR tokens to voters, contributing to the voter's vote power. These delegations are fluid and can change frequently.

**Addresses and Identity**

- **Identity Address**: This is a cold wallet used for administrative purposes, providing the voter's identity on the network. It's responsible for setting fees, managing associated addresses, and declaring node IDs.
- **Signing Address**: A hot wallet used for signing data in protocols and for submitting signatures. This address is set by the voter and is crucial for participating in consensus mechanisms.
- **Delegation Address**: The address to which the community delegates their WFLR, directly affecting the voter's vote power.
- **Prioritized Submission Addresses**: Addresses used for efficient communication with the blockchain, particularly for submitting data and signatures.

**Rewards and Fees**

- **Direct Rewards**: Voters receive rewards from sub-protocols either as direct rewards or based on their participation weight.
- **Fee Structure**: Voters can set fees for delegators and stakers, influencing the attractiveness of participating with them.

### Voting Periods

**Voting Epochs**

- **Duration**: Each voting epoch lasts 90 seconds, serving as the fundamental time unit in the voting process.
- **Identification**: Voting epochs are identified by a unique ID, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent epoch.
- **Function**: Voting rounds for sub-protocols occur within these epochs, allowing for frequent and timely consensus decisions.

**Reward Epochs**

- **Composition**: Reward epochs consist of multiple voting epochs, typically lasting 3.5 days or 3360 voting epochs.
- **Identification**: Each reward epoch is identified by a reward epoch ID.
- **Purpose**: Used to fix voters, their weights, and the signing policy for a specific period, ensuring stability in the consensus mechanism.

### Voting Process and Finalization

**Merkle Root Agreement**

- **Process**: Voters independently calculate candidate Merkle roots based on protocol data, which may include off-chain data verification or consensus on off-chain calculations.
- **Signing**: Voters sign these Merkle roots and publish the signatures on-chain.
- **Data Integrity**: The use of Merkle roots ensures data integrity and allows for efficient verification of large datasets.

**Confirmation Threshold**

- **Threshold Value**: A Merkle root is confirmed when it is signed by voters whose combined weight exceeds a predefined threshold, typically over 50% of the total voting weight.
- **Security**: The threshold ensures that no single voter or small group can unilaterally confirm data, maintaining network security.

**Finalization**

- **Relay Contract**: Finalization involves aggregating sufficient signatures and submitting them to the **Relay Contract**.
- **Verification**: The Relay Contract verifies signatures, checks voter eligibility, and confirms that the combined weight meets the threshold.
- **Authoritative Storage**: Once finalized, the Merkle root is stored on the Relay Contract, serving as the authoritative source for that protocol's results.

### Use of Confirmed Voting Results

**Verification Process**

- **Data Required**:
  1. **Protocol Data Result Record**: A record (usually in JSON format) containing the data relevant to the protocol.
  2. **Voting Round ID**: The ID of the voting round in which the Merkle root was confirmed.
  3. **Merkle Proof**: A sequence of hashes linking the data record to the Merkle root.
- **Contract Verification**:
  - The smart contract hashes the data record and applies the Merkle proof to obtain the candidate Merkle root.
  - It retrieves the confirmed Merkle root from the Relay Contract.
  - If the roots match, the data is considered valid, and the contract can act upon it.
- **Efficiency**: This mechanism allows smart contracts to verify large amounts of data securely and efficiently without storing all the data on-chain.

### Voting (Signing) Policies

**Definition and Purpose**

- **Signing Policy**: A set of rules defined for each reward epoch, specifying eligible voters, their weights, and the confirmation threshold.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the consensus mechanism operates with an agreed-upon set of participants and rules, providing predictability and security.

**Components Explained**

- **Eligible Voters**: The list of voters who are permitted to participate in the consensus process for the reward epoch.
- **Weights**: Normalized weights assigned to each voter based on their aggregated stakes and delegations.
- **Threshold**: The minimum combined weight of voters required to confirm a Merkle root.
- **Seed**: A secure random seed used for operations within the epoch, such as random number generation.

**Signing Policy Definition Protocol**

- **Process**:
  - **Random Number Acquisition**: Begins before the end of the current reward epoch to obtain a secure random number.
  - **Vote Power Block Selection**: A specific block is selected to determine vote power snapshots, ensuring consistency in weight calculations.
  - **Voter Registration**: Potential voters register for the upcoming epoch, declaring their addresses and node IDs.
  - **Signing Policy Snapshot**: The new signing policy is finalized and stored on-chain, which enables the start of the new reward epoch.
- **Incentivization**:
  - Penalties are applied for delays or failure to participate in the signing process.
  - **Burn Factors**: Calculated penalties that reduce rewards for non-compliance or tardiness.

### Weight Definition

**Participation Weights**

- **WM (Mirrored Stake Weight)**: Represents stakes from the P-chain mirrored onto the C-chain for use in smart contracts.
- **WC (C-chain Stake Weight)**: Planned for future implementation; represents stakes directly on the C-chain.
- **WWFLR (WFLR Delegation Weight)**: Represents wrapped FLR tokens delegated by the community to voters.

**Aggregation Function**

- **Purpose**: Combines the various participation weights to determine a voter's total signing weight.
- **Calculation**:
  - Caps are applied to prevent any single voter from having excessive influence.
  - The function considers the total weight and normalizes individual weights accordingly.

### Weight Participation and Fees

**Delegators and Stakers**

- **Community Involvement**: Members can contribute to a voter's weight by delegating WFLR or staking FLR tokens.
- **Influence**: Their participation directly affects the voter's vote power and potential rewards.

**Fees**

- **Setting Fees**: Voters set fees for their delegators and stakers, influencing how attractive they are to the community.
- **Impact on Rewards**: Fees are deducted from rewards before distribution to participants.

**Rewards**

- **Distribution**: Rewards are distributed proportionally based on each participant's contribution to the voter's weight.
- **Incentivization**: Encourages community members to support reliable and efficient voters.

### Signing Threshold and Signatures

**Threshold Determination**

- **Standard Threshold**: Typically set at over 50% of the total voting weight to confirm a Merkle root.
- **Adjustments**: May vary depending on the protocol's security requirements or network conditions.

**Signature Mechanism**

- **ECDSA Signatures**: Standard cryptographic signatures used for signing protocol messages.
- **Protocol Messages**: Contain essential data such as protocol ID, voting round ID, random quality score, and Merkle root.
- **Verification**: Signatures are verified during finalization to ensure they are from eligible voters and meet the threshold.

### Random Number Generation

**Mechanism**

- **FTSO Scaling Sub-protocol**: Provides secure random numbers using a commit-reveal scheme.
- **Commit-Reveal Scheme**:
  - **Commit Phase**: Voters commit to a value without revealing it.
  - **Reveal Phase**: Voters reveal their committed values, which are combined to produce a random number.

**Usage**

- **Protocol Operations**: Random numbers are essential for operations like selecting voters for rewards or determining the order of finalization.
- **Security**: Ensures fairness and prevents predictability in the consensus process.

**Access**

- **Relay Contract**: The random number is included in the Merkle roots stored on the Relay Contract.
- **Quality Score**: Indicates whether the random number is fully secure or has issues due to network delays or potential attacks.

## Rewarding and Claiming

### Reward Claims

**Types of Claims**

- **Direct Claims**: Rewards owed solely to a specific beneficiary, typically a voter's identity address.
- **Fee Claims**: Similar to direct claims but specifically for the fees collected from delegations and stakes.
- **Weight-Based Claims**:
  - **WFLR Claims**: For rewards distributed to WFLR delegators.
  - **Mirror Claims**: For rewards distributed to P-chain stakers.
  - **C-chain Claims**: For future distribution based on C-chain stakes.

**Reward Calculation**

- **Partial Claims**: Each sub-protocol calculates partial reward claims based on participation and protocol-specific rules.

- **Merkle Tree**: The aggregated claims are organized into a Merkle tree for efficient storage and verification.

### Reward Claiming Process

**Initialization**

- **Merkle Root Confirmation**: Requires the Merkle root for the reward epoch to be confirmed through the Reward Voting Protocol.
- **Variables Tracked**:
  - **Unclaimed Weight**: The total participation weight that has not yet been claimed.
  - **Unclaimed Amount**: The total reward amount that remains unclaimed.

**Weight-Based Claiming**

- **Delegator Claims**: Delegators claim rewards proportional to their participation in the voter's weight.
- **Process**:
  - Delegators submit a claim, and the contract calculates their share based on their contribution.
  - The unclaimed weight and amount are updated accordingly.

**Fees**

- **Deduction**: Voter fees are deducted from the total reward amount before distribution to delegators and stakers.
- **Fee Setting**: Voters can adjust their fees, influencing delegator participation.

### Rewarding Architecture
