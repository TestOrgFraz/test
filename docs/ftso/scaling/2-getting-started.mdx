Scaling provides offchain access to anchor feeds, using Flare's network of 100 independent data providers and a full commit-reveal process every 90 seconds.
This section demonstrates how to consume anchor feeds on Flare. The key steps to read an anchor feed are:

1. **Query the feed with associated proof:**

   The simplest method is to use the Data Availability (DA) Layer API, which returns both the feed and proof data. Alternatively, you can also retrieve this data via an API exposed by an FTSOv2 data provider.

2. **Push the feed and proof to the onchain smart contract:**

   **Verification**: The smart contract must validate the feed and proof data against the onchain Merkle root.

   **Usage**: Once verified, the feed can be used in the smart contract according to your application logic.

Scaling stores only a commitment to feed data onchain, while the complete feed data remains offchain. However, this data can be verified onchain against the Merkle root, ensuring data integrity and resilience against tampering.

## Querying DA Layer API

:::warning[Data Availability Layer: Beta Release]

The Data Availability (DA) Layer is currently in beta.
You are encouraged to explore its features and share any feedback, report bugs, or suggest improvements on the [flare-foundation](https://github.com/flare-foundation) GitHub.

:::

The standardized DA Layer API allows you to query the value and proof for multiple feeds from the same voting epoch at once. To obtain pricing data from DA Layer, use the `anchor-feeds-with-proof` POST endpoint. For example, to get the feed value of `BTC/USD` at voting round ID `802550`:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="curl" label="curl" default>

    ```bash
    curl -X 'POST' \
      'https://API_URL/api/v0/ftso/anchor-feeds-with-proof?voting_round_id=802550' \
      -H 'accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
      "feed_ids": [
        "0x014254432f55534400000000000000000000000000"
      ]
    }'
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="javascript" label="Javascript">

    <CodeBlock language="javascript" title="query_dalayer.js">
      {QueryDALayer}
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

The response will look something like:

```json
[
  {
    "body": {
      "votingRoundId": 802550,
      "id": "0x014254432f55534400000000000000000000000000",
      "value": 6777692,
      "turnoutBIPS": 9776,
      "decimals": 2
    },
    "proof": [
      "0x19af2ab8054d0f01b65ae30a4ec9497b8a51a75c3194ea5d1873980ed0fa1a58",
      "0xb9d5a8e6df11f9508c443bf3908e8e66adc813516cb9a846ca7066cfff2e13cb",
      "0x132ccc9b9632b9020f1a3181c82f31918f107120dd6fff262af80b98bd340d62",
      "0xac173708f874d6c2676a60052da54f9dc2a41c29faed776d2cc6b9d37436bafe",
      "0xf8e6e44b30d56cf72929c29d5ad95e6e964baa9bae3b116eb09ad448129340c3"
    ]
  }
]
```

You can request multiple feed IDs in a single query by providing a list of `feed_ids`. A list of valid feed IDs is available on the [Anchor Feeds](/ftso/scaling/anchor-feeds) page.

### Defining onchain consumer

To verify and use anchor feed data onchain, [`FtsoV2Interface`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface) provides an easy-to-use Solidity interface. You can access this interface in two ways:

- Using the `getFtsoV2()` method from [@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package.

- Using the [`getContractAddressByName()`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyname) method on the Flare Contract Registry with name `FtsoV2`.

[`FtsoV2Interface`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface) provides a method [`verifyFeedData`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#verifyfeeddata), which validates the feed data and proof against the Merkle root stored onchain.
The function requires a single input struct [`FeedDataWithProof`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#feeddatawithproof), which includes the feed data and voting round ID within the [`FeedData`](/ftso/solidity-reference/FtsoV2Interface#feeddata) struct, and a Merkle proof.

This sample contract verifies feed data and stores it onchain if the proof is valid:

<CodeBlock language="solidity" title="FTSOV2FeedConsumerScaling.sol">
  {FTSOV2FeedConsumerScaling}
</CodeBlock>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
<Remix fileName="FTSOV2FeedConsumerScaling.sol">Open in Remix</Remix>
<br></br>

### Pushing anchor feeds onchain

The following example shows how to query feed and proof data from DA Layer and submit it to the onchain consumer:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="query_dalayer_and_push_onchain.js">
  {QueryDALayerAndPushOnchain}
</CodeBlock>

## Querying data provider API

Data providers can also query their own API for specific feed data. This onchain verification is similar to the DA-Layer but the offchain query is different:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" title="query_provider_and_push_onchain.js">
  {QueryProviderAndPushOnchain}
</CodeBlock>

{/* Verifying the price and proof offchain */}

{/* ## The `FeedData` struct */}
