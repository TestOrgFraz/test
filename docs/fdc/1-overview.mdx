FDC is currently under development.

Get involved in alpha testing on Flare Testnet Coston2 by following the [FDC Guides](/category/fdc-guides).

The **F**lare **D**ata **C**onnector **(FDC)** achieves consensus on information from external blockchains and the internet, ensuring it can be securely and trustlessly utilized by smart contracts on Flare.

FDC employs a network of independent attestation providers to retrieve necessary information from other blockchains and deliver it to the Flare network. The FDC smart contract then verifies consensus among the received data, making the results available to the network when consensus is achieved.

FDC operates in two modes:

1. Reading the state of other blockchains, such as verifying if a deposit has been made by a given block height.
2. Providing data proofs from open internet APIs, like confirming if a specific tweet was sent, a particular sporting result occurred, or if a bank transaction was completed.
