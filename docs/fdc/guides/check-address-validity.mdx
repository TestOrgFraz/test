## Address Validity

[Full specification on GitHub](https://github.com/flare-foundation/songbird-state-connector-protocol/blob/main/specs/attestations/active-types/AddressValidity.md).

And there is a sub-specification for each chain that specifies the rules for the address validity for each chain. Be careful: Bitcoin and Dogecoin have different rules for validity on the mainnet and testnet, so make sure to check the correct specification with the correct verifier.

This is a very simple attestation type that can prove that a string constitutes a valid address on the specified chain. Importantly, unlike the `Payment` type we saw in [Part 1](data-connector), this type does not require a transaction to be proven. It just offloads the computation of the address validity to the verifier so that expensive computation does not have to be done onchain.

This is useful if you want to ensure that the address is valid before using it in your protocol. For example, fAssets need to make sure that an address is valid before they can be used in the protocol, and this is a good way to offload difficult computation regarding when the bitcoin address is valid to offchain entities.

For more information on Bitcoin address validity, see the [Bitcoin design guide glossary](https://bitcoin.design/guide/glossary/address/).

The request body is very simple—it just contains the `addressStr`, which is the address to be verified according to the chain's rules.

The response body contains all the important details. Generally, the request can always be confirmed. Here are the specific fields to look at:

- **`isValid`**: A boolean indicator of the address validity.
  - If this is true, the address is valid according to the chain's rules.
  - Remember, the Merkle proof is about the validity of this request (if it was confirmed by the verifiers), not about the meaning of its response—whether the address is valid or not.
- **`standardAddress`**: If `isValid`, this is the standard form of the validated address; otherwise, it is an empty string.
  - This is useful if you want to use the address in your protocol, as you can use the standard form of the address and not worry about different representations of the same address.
- **`standardAddressHash`**: If `isValid`, this is the standard address hash of the validated address; otherwise, it is a zero bytes32 string.
  - This is useful to verify with the standard address hash returned by `Payment` and `ReferencedPaymentNonexistence`.

Think of this as an example of what can be offloaded to offchain computation (and verification). Try to imagine other tasks that are prohibitively expensive (or impossible due to data unavailability) onchain that can be offloaded to offchain computation.

### Example

The script for address validity (`tryAddressValidity.ts`) is simpler than the scripts we've seen so far. There's no need to create a transaction or anything complex; you just call the `prepareResponse` endpoint and see the result. In actual use, you will first prepare a request for the Data Connector, wait for it to be confirmed, and then use the response in your smart contract together with the proof. This means your smart contract will receive the result of a potentially large and expensive calculation (the response body part) along with proof that it was included in the Merkle root. This attests that it has been calculated and verified by the network validator.

This setup ensures that your smart contract gets a verified result without having to perform the expensive calculation onchain, thereby saving computational resources and improving efficiency.

One might ask what use such an attestation type is and why all the checks are necessary. Consider it in two ways:

- **Data Contains Request and Response**: This setup makes it possible to observe both the input (request) and output (response) of the computation. The computation can be very complex and expensive, but for our purposes, we only need to know the result (and, of course, the input we want to be observed), and we can act on it.
- **Merkle Proof**: The Merkle proof is used to verify that the response was included in the committed root and was confirmed by the verifiers. The "being confirmed" part is crucial because it means the verifiers have indeed seen the request, performed the computation (arriving at the same result), and included the result in the Merkle root, which we base our actions on.

This approach ensures that complex and resource-intensive computations can be performed offchain while still providing verifiable and trustworthy results that can be used onchain.
