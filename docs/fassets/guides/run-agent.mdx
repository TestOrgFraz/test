Agents are integral to FAssets system, facilitating the use of tokens from blockchains that lack smart contract capabilities with smart contracts on the Flare blockchain.

This guide includes:

1. Setting up the FAssets CLI.
2. Configuring access keys for interaction with the Songbird Testnet Coston and the test XRP Ledger network.
3. Establishing an FAssets agent and providing collateral.
4. Operating the agent to enable FAssets system users to convert (mint and redeem) assets between the testnet XRP Ledger and Songbird Testnet Coston.

## Contract Addresses

These are important FAssets smart contract addresses representing test tokens and notable system components, provided for your convenience during the Open Beta on the Songbird Testnet Coston.

### ERC20 Test Tokens

:::

## Registration

### Install repository

1. Clone the [fasset-bots](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots) repository and switch to the `open_beta` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots.git
   cd fasset-bots
   git checkout open_beta
   ```

2. Install the dependencies and build the project:

   ```bash
   yarn && yarn build
   ```

3. Copy the environment file from `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Configure Access Keys

The FAsset agents operate with multiple keys for the Flare and underlying network chains. You should generate these keys to make the agent operational.

1. Create or use an existing management (cold) wallet that will be your agent's management address. Fund this wallet with some CFLR for gas using the [Coston Faucet](https://faucet.flare.network/coston).

2. Generate secrets using the following command, replace `MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your wallet address:

   ```bash
   yarn key-gen generateSecrets --user --agent MANAGEMENT_WALLET_ADDRESS --other -o secrets.json
   ```

3. Start the [whitelisting process](#whitelist-management-address) to grant your agent's management address access to the FAssets system. While waiting for approval, you can proceed to the next steps.

4. The `secrets.json` file contains the `owner.native.address` field, representing the Flare account responsible for funding agent vaults and covering gas fees for smart contract calls. Ensure this wallet has enough CFLR tokens to cover gas fees for smart contract calls.

5. Change the permissions for the `secrets.json` file:

   ```bash
   chmod 600 secrets.json
   ```

6. Fill the `native_rpc`, `xrp_rpc` and `indexer` fields in the `secrets.json` file with the following values:

   ```json
   // Songbird Testnet Coston
   "native_rpc": "AavSehMLhcgz3crQHH5YJ3Rt8GMQGdV9aViGilADXGnTcjij",
   "xrp_rpc": "4tg3AxysaZodxTqsCtcMnBdBIEkR6KDKGTdqBEA8g9MKq4bH",
   "indexer": "123456",
   ```

### Whitelist Management Address

To access the FAssets system during the open beta, you must be whitelisted for security reasons. This ensures only authorized participants interact with the system, maintaining a secure and controlled environment for testing and platform improvement. The whitelisting process will be removed after the open beta.

1. Find your agent owner address, which is the `owner.management.address` value in `secrets.json`.

2. Use the [FlareFAssetsBot Telegram channel](https://t.me/FlareFAssetsBot), specifically designed for registration, and provide the necessary information, including your agent name and description and, optionally, a link to your icon.

3. Enter the information and confirm it. The Telegram bot will inform you about the successful process.

4. Wait for Flare support engineers to approve registrations and issue test assets such as CFLR, testUSDC, testUSDT, and testETH assets, which will be sent to your `owner.management.address`. While you wait, you can continue with the rest of this guide.

5. If the information you entered is correct, the Telegram Bot will notify you that you have been whitelisted for the FAssets Open Beta.

#### Check Whitelist Status

1. Navigate to the `AgentOwnerRegistry` contract on the Coston Explorer and open the **Read Contract** tab:

   `AgentOwnerRegistry`: [`0xDb6c11b8D074D4488f5fFd0129AA5F91C4f00fb6`](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0xDb6c11b8D074D4488f5fFd0129AA5F91C4f00fb6/read-contract#address-tabs)

2. Execute the `isWhitelisted` function with the value of `owner.management.address` from `secrets.json`. This function returns a boolean: `true` of the address is whitelisted or `false` if it is not.

## Setup

### Configure Native Address

Configuring the native address links your agent's work address to the management address and grants access.

1. Navigate to the `AgentOwnerRegistry` contract on the Coston Explorer and open the **Write Contract** tab:

   `AgentOwnerRegistry`: [`0xDb6c11b8D074D4488f5fFd0129AA5F91C4f00fb6`](https://coston-explorer.flare.network/address/0xDb6c11b8D074D4488f5fFd0129AA5F91C4f00fb6/write-contract#address-tabs)

2. Connect the wallet you used to generate the access keys.

3. Register the work address by executing the `setWorkAddress` function with the value of `owner.native.address` from `secrets.json`.

### Configure the Agent

You need to set up your agent's parameters like name, collateral, and fund with underlying assets.

1.  Prepare the agent settings `tmp.agent-settings.json` file:

    ```bash
    yarn agent-bot --fasset FTestXRP create --prepare
    ```

2.  Choose a suffix for your agent's collateral pool and fill in the `poolTokenSuffix` field in the `tmp.agent-settings.json` file with it.
    The `poolTokenSuffix` should only include uppercase letters, numbers, and the `-` symbol.
    This suffix will be used for the FAsset Collateral Pool Token. For example, if you use `MY-ALPHA-AGENT-1`, it would be `FCPT-TXRP-MY-ALPHA-AGENT-1`.

3.  Choose one of the stable tokens (`testUSDT` or `testUSDC`) or wrapped ETH in `vaultCollateralFtsoSymbol` to back up the agent vault collateral.

4.  In the `secrets.json` file, the `owner.testXRP.address` field is the underlying testnet XRP Ledger account that pays the underlying chain's transaction fees.
    Activate your underlying XRPL account by sending at least 100 testnet XRP using either one of the faucets:

    - [Bithomp XRPL Testnet Faucet](https://test.bithomp.com/faucet/)
    - [Tequ XRPL Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.tequ.dev/)

5.  Create the agent by specifying the FAsset and agent settings, noting that this operation can take up to 10 minutes because the FAssets verifies the underlying assets.
    This command will print out your agent's address.

    ```bash
    yarn agent-bot --fasset FTestXRP create tmp.agent-settings.json
    ```

### Deposit Collateral

To make your newly created agent public, it must hold enough collateral to mint one lot. This means its agent vault contract needs to be funded with the two collateral assets (CFLR and a stablecoin or wrapped ETH) held by your `owner.native.address`. Flare support sends test assets to your `owner.management.address`, so remember to move these funds to the `owner.native.address`.

There are two options:

- Deposit vault and pool collateral together.

- Deposit vault and pool collateral separately.

#### Deposit Vault and Pool Collateral Together

To deposit both vault and pool collateral together and let the tool calculate the minimum required collateral to back the lots, you can use the `depositCollateral` function to the agent, specifying your created agent address in the `AGENT_ADDRESS` and lot size in the `LOTS`:

```bash
yarn agent-bot depositCollaterals AGENT_ADDRESS LOTS --fasset FTestXRP
```

#### Deposit Vault and Pool Collateral Separately

1. Deposit enough vault collateral to the agent specifying your created agent address in the `AGENT_ADDRESS` and the amount of the stablecoin or wrapped ETH in the `AMOUNT` field.

   ```bash
   yarn agent-bot depositVaultCollateral AGENT_ADDRESS AMOUNT --fasset FTestXRP
   ```

2. Buy enough pool collateral for the agent specifying your agent's address in the `AGENT_ADDRESS` and the amount of the CFLR in the `CFLR_AMOUNT` field.

   ```bash
   yarn agent-bot buyPoolCollateral AGENT_ADDRESS CFLR_AMOUNT --fasset FTestXRP
   ```

### Register as Available

You need to make your agent available to mint and redeem FAssets.

1. Register your agent as available to the network by executing this command replacing the `AGENT_ADDRESS` with your agent address:

   ```bash
   yarn agent-bot enter AGENT_ADDRESS --fasset FTestXRP
   ```

   :::warning

   To prevent failures, ensure that your agent owner's Flare account has completed the whitelisting process via the [FlareFAssetsBot Telegram channel](https://t.me/FlareFAssetsBot).

   :::

2. If you deposited enough collateral, you should see that your agent has at least one lot available by running the command.

   ```bash
   yarn user-bot agents --fasset FTestXRP
   ```

If you don't have available lots, check if the vault and pool collaterals are enough.

## Run the Agent

The agent bot responds to all requests made to the agent vaults you have created.
To run the agent bot, you need to run the following command:

```bash
yarn run-agent
```

When you want to stop the server, press Ctrl + C.

### Maximize agent uptime

1. Download the example [`agent-bot.service`](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fasset-bots/blob/main/docs/systemd/agent-bot.service) from the repository.

2. Modify the following variables in `agent-bot.service`:

   - **WorkingDirectory**: Set this to your `fasset-bots` checkout directory.
   - **User**, **Group**: Set these to the user under which the service should run.
   - **ExecStart**: If required, change the path to `node`.

3. Copy the modified service file to `systemd` directory:

   ```bash
   sudo cp agent-bot.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```

4. Reload the `systemd` daemon to recognize the new service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

5. **Manage the service:**

   To start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start agent-bot
   ```

   To stop the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop agent-bot
   ```

6. Enable auto-start on boot:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable agent-bot
   ```

7. **View service logs:**

   Follow the console output live:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -fu agent-bot.service
   ```

   View past logs in `less`:

   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -eu agent-bot.service
   ```

:::tip

- Always verify the paths and user permissions when setting up the service to avoid common issues.
- Use `sudo systemctl status agent-bot` to check the status and troubleshoot any problems with the service.

### Verify contracts

Ensuring the security and transparency of FAssets involves verifying the `CollateralPool` and `CollateralPoolToken` smart contracts on a block explorer. The following steps will guide you through the verification process on the [Coston Explorer](https://coston-explorer.flare.network).

1. **Get the CollateralPool Contract Address:**

   Execute the FAssets system information command to determine your `CollateralPool` contract address.

   ```bash
   yarn agent-bot info AGENT_ADDRESS --fasset FTestXRP
   ```

   Locate and copy the address from the **Agent collateral pool** field:

   ```

2. **Clone the fassets Repository:**

   Clone the [fassets](https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fassets) repository and switch to the `open_beta` branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flare-labs-ltd/fassets.git
   cd fassets
   git checkout open_beta
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and build the project:**

   ```bash
   yarn && yarn c
   ```

4. **Verify the Contracts:**

   Run the following command, using the collateral pool address obtained in step 1 as `AGENT_POOL_ADDRESS`:

   ```bash
   yarn verify-collateral-pool-coston AGENT_POOL_ADDRESS
   ```

   The verification process takes a few minutes. You should see an output indicating that the `CollateralPool` and `CollateralPoolToken` contracts have been verified:
